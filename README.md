# RazorPagesMovie

I thought this tutorial was nice to see some of the differences between MVC and razor pages.
I do like that there are really only 2 things to think about rather than 3 with MVC. 
I feel like it's easier to keep things organized as well. Something I thought was cool was the @page attribute which lets
you easily make changes to how your routes will look.
